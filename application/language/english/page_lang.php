/* Concept */
$lang['concept_heading'] = "What en2uition is about...";
$lang['concept_column1'] = "                    

<p>
<strong> What en2uition is: </strong>
<br> En2uition is a social network that provides people in romantic relationships with predictive and assessment algorithms. 
En2uition provides its users with a 'machine' that collects romantic relationship data from them, analyzes that data, extracts 
intelligent information using artificial intelligence and then gives that intelligent information back to the users.
</p>

<p>
<strong> Motivation: </strong>
<br>
Romantic relationships are a crucial part of everybody's life and happiness. When they become problematic people usually seek objective 
understanding of the problem, suggestions about how to fix their relationships or even prediction of the possible outcomes. Some of the 
ways people try to get the information they need is by reading astrology, visit a psychic or talk to friends. Astrology and visits to 
psychics are not what we call a scientific way to get the right answers. 
</p>

<p>
Talking to friends is a much better alternative. That's because when people do that they share experiences from past relationships and by 
analyzing them they try to extract patterns and compare what happened in the past with what's happening now. However, the number of past 
experiences a group of friends may have had in the past can never be high enough that would enable people to extract patterns from it. Hence 
this method cannot provide a reliable feedback.
</p>

<p>    
<strong> What en2uition does: </strong>
<br>   
In the en2uition community each individual provides information about a failed or a successful (led to long term commitment/ marriage) 
romantic relationship. Artificial intelligence algorithms analyze thousands of relationship data and extract patterns that can provide 
instant feedback and prediction to the user in a way that no human can do. You can think of this as if you had thousands of friends with 
who you could share and analyze your past relationship experiences and get feedback from all of them instantaneously.    
</p>

<p>
The en2uition users can choose to answer a 'past questionnaire' and a 'present questionnaire' (consisting of questions about a past and a 
present relationship respectively). The answers to the 'past questionnaire' are used to provide the user with a feedback about what 'relationship 
type' (s)he is and therefore the user will be assigned to a certain 'relationship category'. The answers to the 'present questionnaire' are used 
to provide the user with predictions about his/her present relationship.    
</p>

<p>
<strong> How en2uition works: </strong>
<br> We refer to the relationship patterns our algorithms detect as 'relationship categories'. Users that are assigned to the same 'relationship 
category' did their past relationships in a similar way and hence they have a lot of common experiences. Each 'relationship category' is resembled 
by a shape (eg. triangle, square, circle etc). A user is assigned to the shape that resembles the 'relationship category (s)he belongs to.    
</p>

<p>
En2uition users also get assigned to a color. Depending on the user's relationship status ('in a serious relationship', 'in a casual relationship',
'single and bored', 'single having fun') the user will be assigned a color red, yellow, blue or green respectively. The color assignment combined 
with the shape of the 'relationship category' assignment imply that each user will be assigned to a colored shape. The shape represents the 'relationship 
category' and the color represents the relationship status.
</p>

";
$lang['concept_column2'] = "

<p>
<strong> What en2uition offers:  </strong>
<br> En2uition offers access to intelligent analyses of thousands of relationship data for the purpose of getting a feedback about a past 
relationship and a prediction about a present relationship. En2uition is free for everybody to join. The users will find intelligent and free 
advice that can get them motivated to think about their past relationships and understand more about their relationships as well as themselves.

<p>
In addition to the above, en2uition offers networking based on similarities of past romantic relationship experiences. Users are categorized 
based on how they participated in past relationships and they can choose to interact with other users based on this classification. The interaction 
can involve discussions in forums, exchanging messages, sharing photos as well as sharing their answers (in a controlled way) to the questionnaires.     
</p>

<p>
<strong> Why en2uition works: </strong> 
<br> En2uition works because it is based on how real people participate in real romantic relationships in real time. This is not a guess work, 
it is not based on personal opinions or personal hypotheses. The feedback and predictions are based on how real romantic relationships are done 
in real societies in real countries we live in. En2uition is not based on astrology, psychic 'powers' or any other controversial methods. 
</p>

<p>
En2uition uses real data and discovers similarities between people's relationships. This data is collected by using a questionnaire that provides a 
summary of all possible decisive factors for the future success or failure of a romantic relationship. The “relationship categories” detected by our 
algorithms will provide information on similarities among users and also on the unique paths of failed and successful romantic relationships.
</p>

<p>    
<strong> How en2uition evolves: </strong>
<br>  
Our algorithms are running continuously on updated and incoming flow of data by new users. As data increases, our algorithms will systematically 
update the “relationship categories” and also update their predictive analysis. Therefore, en2uition will keep improving its feedback and prediction 
accuracies over time. The more users join en2uition over time the more accurate the feedback and predictions will become.
</p>

<p>
Eventually, given sufficient amount of data from many countries around the world, the algorithms will provide patterns and analysis that will be 
country and culture specific. Dating and relationship cultures differ from country to country, however, given enough data en2uition will provide 
feedback and prediction based on the cultural background of the user. 
</p>

<p>
<strong> How en2uition is unique: </strong>
<br>
Currently there is no website based on romantic relationships that collects, stores, analyzes and provides scientifically based feedback to users.
En2uition provides a unique scientific method (available to everybody for free) that can provide feedback and predictions based on real life 
relationship data analyzed using scientific methods.
</p>

<p>
En2uition was developed to accommodate users of all relationship statuses: in relationship and single. Users of 'single' status can use the en2uition
machine to get feedback and analyze a past relationship. Users that are currently 'in relationship' status in addition to the feedback about a past 
relationship they can also get a prediction about their current relationship.

                          The Past Relationship Questionnaire is a questionnaire that consists of questions about an important romantic relationship you 
                          had in the past. Due to its length the questionnaire is split into 6 levels (about 60 questions each level) and an outcome 
                          level. The 6 levels consist of questions about how you and your partner participated in your dating relationship and the 
                          outcome level consists of questions about how you and your partner assessed the dating relationship (assessment is asked to be
                          provided by the user in steps of 1.5 months time intervals. 
                      </p>      
                      <p> <strong> Time frame: </strong> The time frame covered by the questionnaire is from day 1 that you and your partner started dating 
                          until the end of the "dating relationship". The term "dating relationship" represents the relationship from the first day you and your 
                          partner started dating until the day you either broke up permanently or you decided the dating relationship should move on to a more 
                          serious engagement or marriage. Therefore, the end of the dating relationship can either be bad due to a permanent break up or good 
                          due to an engagement or marriage.

                          needed. The levels have to be answered in order from lower to higher number i.e. level 1 has to be answered first, level 2 
                          next, then level 3 etc. When level 1 is completed you can go to the "Analyze" page in order to run our algorithms and get a
                          feedback about your past relationship. After you get a feedback based on level 1, you can move on to level 2. After completing 
                          level 2 you can go to the "Analyze" page again and this time the algorithms will analyze the results of level 1 and level 2 combined.
                          After you answer level 3, the algorithms will run on level 1, 2 and 3 combined etc...

                          your past relationship in a "relationship category". There are 16 possible relationship categories and in each category we gather relationships 
                          that are similar to each other. That means that users that are assigned to that category had similar past experiences and hence they have 
                          a lot in common they can discuss. Each relationship category is resembled by a shape. This shape will get assigned to the user and this
                          shape will also resemble the "relationship type" of the user.

                          between the first day you met your partner and the time at the end of the dating relationship. Level 1 ends with questions 
                          about the early history of your relationship: establishment and early intimate encounters (mental and physical).

                          communication by phone calls and text messages, hanging out with each others friends and each others family. An important part of 
                          this level is the detailed questions about the sexual communication of the couple in the bedroom.

                         In this level there are questions about how much you and your partner agree when discussing the above topics, how many times you have 
                         fights when discussing and how compromising you and your partner are. Level 5 also includes questions about who initiates resolutions

                         questions about inner thoughts that each one of you and your partner may have for each other. Most of these personal questions are hard to  
                         know during the early stages of a relationship, however, given enough time it should be easy to guess or (in case guessing is hard) the comfort 
                         level should be such that you can ask each other these questions. Level 6 also asks questions about how resistant the relationship is to

                         for (for example what\'s going to happen 2 months from now or 6 months from now or 12 months from now). Then you can get a prediction about one of 24 different factors that can 
                         contribute to the success or failure of a relationship. 
                    </p> 
                     <p> The predictions for each factor will come in two percentages: one for you and one for your partner. For example a prediction could be "In 6 months from now my 
                         enthousiasm will die out: 15%" and "In 6 months from now my partner\'s enthousiasm will die out: 10%". That would tell you that the enthousiasm level is pretty high and the 
                         relationship is doing very well in that aspect. If you change the time frame the percentages will change either positively or negatively according to your answers. In addition,
                         answering more levels may also change the predicitons. The higher level you are the more accurate the predictions will be.
